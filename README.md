- htmlFor pass
- Admin panel
- Native form validation
- Server Function return handling for Sonner success & errors
- Consider ISR + Caching - generate pages on validated report, "no reports" on non-matching pages, saving DB trip? - [https://tanstack.com/start/latest/docs/framework/react/guide/isr](https://tanstack.com/start/latest/docs/framework/react/guide/isr)
